# College Station Weather in My Local Manjaro Machine

very similar to the college station weather project I've been working on for about 9 months now - however, I feel like with a better understanding of git and a need to have a commit history with no exposed keys, it is my best choice to start a new repository - furthermore, different versions I make for different OSes will now also have different repos entirely, not just different branches
