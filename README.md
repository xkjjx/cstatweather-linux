# College Station Weather in My Local Linux Machine

A successor of the college station weather project I've been working since May 2023 - however, I feel like with a better understanding of git and a need to have a commit history with no exposed keys, it is a good idea to start a new repository - furthermore, different versions I make for different OSes will now also have different repos entirely, not just different branches
