# College Station Weather in My Local Linux Machine

A successor of the college station weather project I've been working since May 2023 - however, I feel like with a better understanding of git and a need to have a commit history with no exposed keys, it is a good idea to start a new repository - furthermore, different versions I make for different OSes will now also have different repos entirely, not just different branches

This program automattically generates a video containing weather information and music and posts to Instagram and Twitter. It uses open weather api, instagram, graph api, twitter api, and cloudinary api for storing videos. It also uses PIL for image processing and moviepy(which uses ffmpeg) for video/audio processing.

Source prepareEnvironment.sh in order to set up and activate a virtual environement with all the required packages installed.
